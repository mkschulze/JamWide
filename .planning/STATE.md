## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- VDO.Ninja browser companion (not embedded WebView) -- keeps plugin lightweight
- OSC via juce_osc (IEM pattern) -- no external deps, proven across 20+ IEM plugins
- Index-based OSC addressing for remote users -- stable fader mapping, name broadcast on roster change
- OSC before Video in v1.1 -- zero new deps, proven patterns, immediate user value
- Phase 11 (Video) independent of OSC phases -- architecturally decoupled
- Companion page on GitHub Pages HTTPS, plugin runs local WebSocket only (mixed-content constraint)
- OSC callbacks must dispatch via callAsync() to preserve SPSC cmd_queue single-producer invariant
- State version bump 1 to 2 for OSC config persistence

### Pending Todos

(Carried from v1.0)

- Phase 3 audio transmission not working end-to-end -- needs debugging

### Known Issues (v1.1 pre-release)

- OSC control not yet working -- needs debugging
- FLAC audio not yet working -- needs debugging
- MIDI Learn not working -- currently under investigation

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 11]: OpenSSL linkage on Windows CI unvalidated -- project now has OpenSSL dependency (Phase 15), CI steps added but untested on Windows
- [Phase 12]: VDO.Ninja external API is self-labeled DRAFT -- may require adaptation
